# The instructions are split across two files 

'Extracting_Gene_Region' is the first step of the analysis. 

'Merging' is the second, and final step of the analysis 

## The reader can begin at one of three steps : 
1. From the very beggening of the analysis with 'Extracting_Gene_Region' 
2. From 'Merging', which requires downloading :NCBI_SNP_EFEMP and GWAS_CATALOG_EFEMP1 from the 'raw_files' directory
3. From Step 10 of 'Merging', which only requires downloading 'EFEMP1_GTEx_Strings' from the 'raw_files' directory
