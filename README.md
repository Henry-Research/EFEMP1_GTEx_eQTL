# Instructions

The analysis process is split across two files:

1. **Extracting_Gene_Region.md**: This is the first step of the analysis.
2. **Merging.md**: This is the second and final step of the analysis.

## Starting Points
The reader can begin the analysis at one of three points:

1. From the very beginning of the analysis with **Extracting_Gene_Region.md**.
2. Directly from the **Merging.md** step, requiring **NCBI_SNP_EFEMP** and **GWAS_CATALOG_EFEMP1** files from the `raw_files` directory.
3. From Step 10 of **Merging.md**, which only requires the **EFEMP1_GTEx_Strings** file from the `raw_files` directory.
